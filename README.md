# Prim's-algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a widely used algorithm in graph theory to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. 
The minimum spanning tree is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices together while minimizing the total edge weight. 
This algorithm ensures that the MST is found efficiently by selecting edges with the smallest weights in a greedy manner.
